## 🌟 Why Use the PoetryDB API?

The PoetryDB API was selected for this project because it aligns perfectly with my goal of creating a themed application centered around poetry. I have a deep appreciation for poems and literature, and I wanted to develop a project that reflects this passion. Here are a few reasons why the PoetryDB API caught my attention:

## Project Setup

- Well-Structured Data: The API returns data in a clear and organized format, making it easy to work with in the application. This facilitates efficient filtering, searching, and displaying of poem details, enriching the overall user experience.
- Community Resource: By utilizing an open-source API, the project promotes access to poetry and encourages users to engage with literary works. This supports my mission of making poetry more accessible to a wider audience.
- Overall, the PoetryDB API enhances the functionality of the Poetry App while allowing me to express my love for literature and create a meaningful project centered on the beauty of poetry.
